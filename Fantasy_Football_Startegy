Data Analysis Strategy

https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/week_1.htm

Variable name https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/<enter year>/<enter_wek>.htm

Then grab all of the the anchor links with the td class = 'right gamelink'

Then access all of links for the data read to get the data.

Once the html has been accessed filter down to 2 tables
1. passing-rushing-receiving
   This will work well as I want to evaluation individual players. It would requrire further breakdowns to get the offesne type but this is good starting data

2. Defensive Rankings
